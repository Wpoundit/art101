			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structures</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The idea of the lab was to further create a local file structure on my computer and add index index.html files</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some trouble uploading my own selfie for the home page. My issue was that I wasn't putting /img in front of the JPG file. I had minimal issues creating the file structre or linking my home page to the labs.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This assignmnet went pretty well and was quite easy. I'd next like to learn how to embed the links within images so that there aren't the ugly hyperlinks on my site. I think I put a good amount of energy into the assigment and toyed around with the CSS for my home page and my lab page</p>
